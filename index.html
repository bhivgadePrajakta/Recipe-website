                                    Preheat the oven to 350°F and line a baking sheet with parchment paper. Toss the

                                    and pepper. Roast until golden brown, 20 to 25 minutes.

                                    Make the cashew cream: Blend together the drained raw cashews, fresh water,

                                    Make the filling: In a medium skillet, heat a drizzle of olive oil over medium
                                    heat. Add the spinach in increments, along with a pinch of salt, and sauté until
                                    all the spinach is incorporated and wilted. Remove from heat and let cool
                                    slightly. Squeeze out any excess liquid and chop. In a medium bowl, combine the
                                    the spinach with the crumbled tofu, oregano, lemon zest, red pepper flakes, at
                                    least 1/4 teaspoon salt, freshly ground black pepper and 1 cup of cashew cream.
                                    Season to taste, adding more salt and pepper as desired.

                                    Assemble the shells. Spread ¼ cup of the reserved cashew cream on the bottom of
                                    an 11x7-inch baking dish. Fill each cooked shell with some of the filling and a
                                    few cubes of butternut squash, and place into the baking dish. Drizzle a little
                                    olive oil over the shells, cover with foil, and bake for 15 minutes, or until
                                    heated through. Remove from the oven and serve with the remaining cashew cream.

                                    Stir in the chopped broccoli stems and cook for another 3 to 5 minutes or until
                                    tender. Add the broccoli florets and leaves and a splash of water or vegetable
                                    broth. Cover and turn off the heat. Allow the broccoli to steam for 2 to 3
                                    minutes or until tender but still bright green. Add the pasta, then stir in ¾ of
                                    the sauce, adding more broth if the sauce is too dry.

                                    Season to taste with more salt, pepper and lemon juice, as desired, and portion
                                    into bowls. Divide the remaining sauce onto each bowl. Top with the pine nuts
                                    and serve with lemon wedges on the side.

                                    Preheat the oven to 350°F and line a baking sheet with parchment paper. Toss the
                                    butternut squash with a drizzle of olive oil and a few generous pinches of salt
                                    and pepper. Roast until golden brown, 20 to 25 minutes.

                                    Make the cashew cream: Blend together the drained raw cashews, fresh water,
                                    garlic, lemon juice, 1/2 teaspoon salt and pepper.
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    Make the filling: In a medium skillet, heat a drizzle of olive oil over medium
                                    heat. Add the spinach in increments, along with a pinch of salt, and sauté until
                                    all the spinach is incorporated and wilted. Remove from heat and let cool
                                    slightly. Squeeze out any excess liquid and chop. In a medium bowl, combine the
                                    the spinach with the crumbled tofu, oregano, lemon zest, red pepper flakes, at
                                    least 1/4 teaspoon salt, freshly ground black pepper and 1 cup of cashew cream.
                                    Season to taste, adding more salt and pepper as desired.
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Add the shells and cook according
                                    to the package directions until al dente. Drain.
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    Assemble the shells. Spread ¼ cup of the reserved cashew cream on the bottom of
                                    an 11x7-inch baking dish. Fill each cooked shell with some of the filling and a
                                    few cubes of butternut squash, and place into the baking dish. Drizzle a little
                                    olive oil over the shells, cover with foil, and bake for 15 minutes, or until
                                    heated through. Remove from the oven and serve with the remaining cashew cream.
